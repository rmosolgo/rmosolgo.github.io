    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful">E.F. Schumacher&rsquo;s <em>Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered</em></a>, so I thought I&rsquo;d jot down a few impressions before I forgot them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Background</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher">Schumacher</a> was a post-WWII British economist. He advised the British National Coal Board (the nationalized coal company) and rebuilding of postwar Germany.</p>

<p>The book was published in 1973, the same year as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis">oil crisis</a>, which raised some questions about our dependence on imported petroleum.</p>

<h2>Greed and Capitalism</h2>

<p>Schumacher returns again and again to a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes#Economic_Possibilities_for_our_Grandchildren_(1930">quote from John Maynard Keynes</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still.</p></blockquote>

<p>In context, Keynes is claiming that eventually, people will recognize will give up a love of money because they find that it doesn&rsquo;t satisfy. But first, a capitalist order must create material abundance.</p>

<p>For Schumacher, this triggers a series of conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Capitalism is predicated on greed.</li>
<li>Greed may &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; the greedy, but it doesn&rsquo;t benefit other individuals or communities.</li>
<li>Since capitalism is built on greed, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect a rising tide to lift all boats. On the contrary, we can expect &ldquo;winners&rdquo; to build boat lifts to raise their own boats.</li>
<li>As a society, when we set our sights on accumulating wealth (for example, by celebrating the rich), we <em>promote</em> greed among ourselves. We shouldn&rsquo;t expect this to ever lead to the renunciation of material wealth.</li>
<li>Since the system is predicated on having <em>more</em>, we should never expect to have <em>enough</em>, and consequently, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect this order to bring any kind of peace.</li>
</ul>


<p>As a modern person, I ask myself, are we arriving at Keynes&rsquo;s expected conclusion? He wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wonder when that &ldquo;When&hellip;&rdquo; is/was expected to arrive.</p>

<h2>Human and Inhuman, Freedom and Order</h2>

<p>Schumacher&rsquo;s understanding of social malaise and environmental destruction boils down to a claim about organizational structure, something like: when an enterprise becomes so big that <em>ownership</em> becomes isolated from <em>execution</em>, it becomes inhuman (in the sense that decision-making can&rsquo;t be made with human-to-human perspective), and as a result, workers are reduced to cogs, natural resources are reduced to consumable inputs, and and the like.</p>

<p>Schumacher assumes (observes?) that when humans make decisions regarding their neighbors and hometowns, they are more likely to consider the non-economic factors of their decisions. For example, a non-economic factor might be a beautiful landscape, a creatively engaging endeavor, or caring for something (or someone) who can&rsquo;t care for itself. For a profit-oriented calculation at headquarters, these factors might be weighed less heavily.</p>

<p>To simplify one of Schumacher&rsquo;s maxims to address this issue, he suggests that <em>nothing should be centralized if it can be decentralized</em>. He acknowledges that some order is required in order for our larger societal goals to be accomplished, but also, he warns that <em>too much</em> order stunts many non-quantifiable joys in life. So, by decentralizing, you can engage human entrepreneurial spirit in a way that is healthy for the localities it impacts.</p>

<h2>Intermediate Technology</h2>

<p>A large section of the book (&ldquo;The Third World&rdquo;) addresses development in poor countries. Schumacher criticizes the dominant mode of development, namely, the installation of capital-intensive heavy industries in large cities. He cites several problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>The purchase of capital (eg, a factory) requires the poor country to take on debt from the rich country, leading to a kind of economic bondage</li>
<li>High-tech industries require a highly-educated workforce, which is often not available locally, so foreign workers (from rich countries) are employed instead of local people. Since Schumacher considers work (at its best) to be an edifying and satisfying experience, this deprives local people of an important benefit of the development.</li>
<li>High-tech, city-oriented development leads to a two-fold economy, where a metropolitan elite exists in a different sphere than their rural compatriots.</li>
<li>High-tech products can&rsquo;t be purchased locally, so they must be exported. This doesn&rsquo;t strengthen the local economy (eg, it doesn&rsquo;t foster more local businesses). Similarly, high-tech industries may require very refined inputs which are not available locally, so instead of using local inputs, the enterprise will depend on imports from elsewhere.</li>
</ul>


<p>Schumacher espouses a different approach, &ldquo;intermediate technology&rdquo;. In this approach, <em>gradual improvements</em> in technology are applied to slowly raise the level of economic activity in a community. For example, if human labor is readily available, a more low-capital, labor-intensive solution might be preferred to a high-capital, low-labor solution. For example, consumer goods might be made by hand instead of by machine, since that will employ more local people and can adapt to a greater variety of inputs. Additionally, <em>several</em> enterprises should be fostered, and they should target local markets, so that newly-employed people can participate in commerce with one another.</p>

<p>I have left out specific examples; the book is full of them.</p>

<p>You can see how this hangs on Schumacher&rsquo;s conviction that work can be good for people. In &ldquo;Buddhist Economics&rdquo;, he highlights some possible benefits of employment, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>It challenges our ego by reminding us that we work together to accomplish things</li>
<li>It fosters social connections by bringing us into necessary contact with one another</li>
<li>It benefits individuals by developing their skill and wisdom</li>
<li>Finally, it produces the things a community needs to survive</li>
</ul>


<p>All these goods focus on the <em>people</em> involved in the enterprise, not the capital or products. Capital should be used in service to the <em>people</em>, not people in service to capital.</p>

<h2>Metaphysical Underpinnings for Economics</h2>

<p>In &ldquo;The Greatest Resource - Education&rdquo;, Schumacher points out the any economic theory rests on a &ldquo;meta-economics&rdquo;, that is, a set of assumptions about what <em>things are</em> and what <em>they mean</em>. He describes it as</p>

<blockquote><p>ideas that would make the world, and [our] own lives, intelligible to [us]; when a thing is intelligible, you have a sense of participation; when a thing is unintelligible, you have a sense of estrangement.</p></blockquote>

<p>Importantly, these things are absorbed and transmitted without our active recognition of it. Our minds are &ldquo;furnished&rdquo; by our communities without our awareness (much less our permission!).</p>

<p>When it comes to our own &ldquo;meta-economics&rdquo;, outlines several of our assumptions about the world:</p>

<ul>
<li>The universe is &ldquo;the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms&rdquo; (he quotes Bertand Russell)</li>
<li>The &ldquo;higher manifestations of life &hellip; are nothing but &hellip; a superstructure erected to disguise and promote economic interest&rdquo;, an application of reductionism to the human experience</li>
<li>&ldquo;[R]elativism, denying all absolutes, dissolving all norms and standards, leading to the total undermining of the idea of truth in pragmatism&hellip;&rdquo; I think this means, rejecting historical understandings of &ldquo;right&rdquo; and replacing them with &ldquo;might is right&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The notion that &ldquo;valid knowledge can be attained only through the natural sciences and hence that no knowledge is genuine unless it is based on generally observable facts.&rdquo; This may be contrasted with the claim that knowledge may be gained through qualitative means, like experience over time or intuitive exploration.</li>
</ul>


<p>For Schumacher, since these ideas give rise to our economics, they can also be understood as the source of our social ills. Since they&rsquo;re responsible for our sense of powerlessness, our quickness to consume and destroy the earth, and our dissatisfaction with these things, we can&rsquo;t expect <em>more</em> of the same to remedy those ills.</p>

<p>Schumacher also prescribes a suite of assumptions which he think will give rise to the kind of economics he espouses:</p>

<ul>
<li>The universe has a hierarchical structure (he says, &ldquo;Levels of Being&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grades of Significance&rdquo;) and it is &ldquo;[our] task &ndash; or simply, if you like, [our] happiness &ndash; to attain a higher degree of realization of [our] potentialities, a higher level of being or &lsquo;grade of significance&rsquo; than that which comes to [us] &lsquo;naturally&rsquo;.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Many important tasks in life require the <em>reconciliation of opposites</em>, and these tasks are not impossible. (&ldquo;How can one reconcile the demands of freedom and discipline in education? Countless mothers and teachers, in fact, do it, but no one can write down a solution.&rdquo;) These tasks (&ldquo;divergent&rdquo;) are contrasted with &ldquo;convergent&rdquo; tasks, such as solving equations or taking measurements, which require finding a solution without clear problem space.</li>
<li>There are virtues and vices. Virtues, which benefit individuals and communities, should be pursued oneself and encouraged in others, while vices, which injure individuals and communities, should be challenged within oneself and discouraged in others.</li>
</ul>


<p>Schumacher points to examples of these assumptions in several philosophical traditions outside post-Enlightenment Western thought.</p>

<p>(This post sat as a draft for a long time. I filled in the last part after returning the book.)</p>

<h2>A Theory of Large Organizations</h2>

<p>At the end of the book, Schumacher provides a <em>positive</em> theory of large organizations. Since I&rsquo;ve returned the book, I&rsquo;ll write the maxim that really stuck with me: anything that <em>can</em> be decentralized <em>should</em> be decentralized.</p>

<p>Toward the end of engaging peoples' entrepreneurial spirit, underlings should be given as much autonomy and authority as possible. Besides doing better work, the boots-on-the-ground folks can make more appropriate consideration of local context.</p>

<p>Schumacher also imagined a really interesting relationship between government and big business. He pointed out that the current arrangement of taxation creates some bizarre incentives: since only profit is taxed, companies work to hide profit from the government. It&rsquo;s impractical that the governemnt <em>builds</em> the infrastructure for businesses to thrive, then puts itself in the position of a bandit, trying to recapture (via taxation) its fair share of the gain.</p>

<p>What if, instead, big companies had the local government as a 50% shareholder? Shumacher proposes that the government party would be observer-only, except in circumstances when the local common good would require some representation. But, the government party would be entitled to 50% of the profit <em>instead</em> of taxing the business. In an arrangement like that, the business is incentivized to grow its profits, and the government doesn&rsquo;t have to fight to recapture its investment in business infrastructure.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any experience in that kind of large-scale thinking, but I found it an interesting scenario to imagine.</p>

<h2>Schumacher&rsquo;s Foundation</h2>

<p>Interestingly, Schumacher clearly builds his vision on a Christian understanding of humans and work. He sees humans as reflecting their creator&rsquo;s nature: creative, social, loving, and capable. At its best, work is not a necessary evil, but instead, it&rsquo;s a <em>good</em> part of culture where people can engage those attributes. That perspective orients his thoughts towards goals other than &ldquo;putting food on the table&rdquo; (although sustenance <em>is</em> a goal), for example, engendering pride in one&rsquo;s work, connections between neighbors, and the development and exercise of human skill.</p>

<h3>Before Jesus: Manna Was &ldquo;Bread from Heaven&rdquo;</h3>

<p>When the Israelites left Egypt, they spent 40 years in the desert as nomads. During this time, their primary sustenance was a food called &ldquo;manna&rdquo; (lit. <em>What is it?</em>). Every morning, it appeared on the surface of the ground. People milled it into flour, then baked cakes with it. This food couldn&rsquo;t be kept overnight; it would spoil.</p>

<p>During this time, God sustained people in a very tangible way. They would have starved in the desert if he hadn&rsquo;t provided them with this miraculous food. The people had no choice but trust God to provide it each day.</p>

<p>(Descriptions of manna: <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Ex16/">Exodos 16</a>, <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Nu11/">Numbers 11</a>)</p>

<h3>Before Jesus: Sacrificed Meat</h3>

<p>Part of the Israelites' relationship with God was animal sacrifice. In short, sacrifices served as &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; between the supplicants (who were imperfect) and God (who was perfect). An animal would be killed, then some parts were burned on the altar. Other parts were given to the priests, to be eaten by them.</p>

<p>In this way, the sacrifice served a double purpose of providing access to God <em>and</em> providing food for full-time clergy.</p>

<p>(Priests eat meat: <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Lv7:28-36/">Leviticus 7</a>, <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/1Cor9:13/">1 Corinthians 9</a>)</p>

<h3>Jesus Is &ldquo;Bread from Heaven&rdquo;</h3>

<p>These two points provide a backdrop for Jesus&rsquo;s claims:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.  This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</p>

<p>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</p>

<p>So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</p></blockquote>

<p>(source: <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Jn6:22/">John 6</a>)</p>

<p>Here, Jesus united the traditions of sacrifice and &ldquo;bread from heaven&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus <em>himself</em> is some kind of better bread than manna.</li>
<li>To eat this bread, you must <em>eat his flesh</em>. (Yuck!?)</li>
<li>As the &ldquo;living bread&rdquo;, Jesus provides <em>absolute</em> sustenance: those who eat it have &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo;, meaning that they&rsquo;ll enjoy eternity in union with God after Jesus&rsquo;s return (cf &ldquo;raised up on the last day&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>


<p>On the night before his arrest (ie, during the &ldquo;last supper&rdquo;), Jesus made this idea concrete:</p>

<blockquote><p>And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</p>

<p>And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, &ldquo;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>(source: <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Lk22:19/">Luke 22</a>)</p>

<p>This instituted the practice of communion, also called the Lord&rsquo;s supper. Communion is a reflection of some points of faith:</p>

<ul>
<li>The bread &amp; wine are <em>imperfect pointers</em> to a perfect &ldquo;food&rdquo;, which is Jesus himself.</li>
<li>Although bread sustains you for short time, believing in Jesus provides eternal life upon Jesus&rsquo;s return.</li>
<li>The bread &amp; wine are stand-ins for Jesus&rsquo;s <em>flesh and blood</em> (😳), and by eating it, we remember Jesus as a sacrifice in both ways mentioned above:

<ul>
<li>Jesus bridges the gap between us and God, allowing us to have a relationship with God</li>
<li>Jesus provides sustenance for day-to-day life (by way of faith in him, in the form of hope for his kingdom to come).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>These are the reasons I enjoy communion. It&rsquo;s a reminder of how God made peace with me, a sinner, by Jesus&rsquo;s sacrifice. As a result, I can trust God to forgive my sin, sustain me in day-to-day life <em>and</em> &ldquo;raise [me] up on the last day&rdquo;.</p>

    <link href="http://rmosolgo.github.io/blog/2015/03/01/debugging-behavior-and-purpose/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-01T15:53:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://rmosolgo.github.io/blog/2015/03/01/debugging-behavior-and-purpose</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To resolve a bug, a developer must know the <em>behavior</em> and the <em>purpose</em> of the program at hand. I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesslie_Newbigin">Lesslie Newbingin</a> and it made me think of this.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are at least two kinds of bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li>The program crashes</li>
<li>The program does not crash, but it does not accomplish the desired result</li>
</ul>


<p>In either case, the developer must draw on two important facts in order to fix the bug:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the <em>current behavior</em> of the program? How does it work?</li>
<li>What is the <em>purpose</em> of the program? Why does it exist?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Debugging: Behavior</h3>

<p>In some cases, a bug expresses itself by causing the program to crash. The fix  may be purely technical:</p>

<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t enter an infinite loop</li>
<li>rectify an off-by-one error</li>
<li>fix a typo in the source code</li>
</ul>


<h3>Debugging: Purpose</h3>

<p>In other cases, a bug does <em>not</em> cause the program to crash. In fact, the program runs fine, but there is still a bug. Here, <em>purpose</em> is essential.</p>

<p>I often ask the product manager, &ldquo;How should this program behave?&rdquo; His response is dictated by the <em>design</em> of the application: why does it exist? What was it made for? What should it accomplish?</p>

<p>No amount of technical information can answer that question.</p>

<h3>Software without Purpose?</h3>

<p>Imagine error handling without purpose. Suppose an external web service returns <code>404 Not Found</code>. How should that be handled by our application? In a program whose design is unknown, the developer has no option but to hide the crash:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">begin
  # do something
rescue
  nil # who knows?
end
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes, this is the norm for American culture. Bugs in society aren&rsquo;t <em>treated</em> as much as <em>suppressed</em>. How could they be treated? We insist that discussions regarding the <em>purpose</em> of humanity are a private matter and not to be addressed in a public way. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s true for you might not be true for me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Product Manager of Product Managers</h3>

<p>A key tenet of Christianity is that, in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, God communicated to humans their purpose. It has traditionally been summarized as  &ldquo;The chief end of man is to worship God and enjoy him forever.&rdquo; This means we ought to live (individually and together) in light of God&rsquo;s supremacy and our togetherness as his children.</p>

<p>This opens the door to much more effective troubleshooting. When the system (human life, human society) fails, we can do more than apply technical bandages; we can refashion the system to better serve the purpose for which it was designed.</p>

<p>Nobody operates under a truly purposeless mindset. Indeed, even when we state a purpose, we find ourselves seeking to fulfill a different one. But we ought to ask: what design <em>should</em> we try to fulfill?</p>

    <link href="http://rmosolgo.github.io/blog/2014/11/18/response-to-why-kids-sext/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-18T21:15:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://rmosolgo.github.io/blog/2014/11/18/response-to-why-kids-sext</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/11/why-kids-sext/380798/">cover article</a> of the November 2014 <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/">Atlantic Monthly</a> told the story of sexting and police involvement in Louisa County, VA.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Sexting is not part of my life, but it&rsquo;s part of our culture (if Snapchat&rsquo;s $2 billion valuation shows anything). When we have kids of our own, I&rsquo;d like to do a good job preparing them for the world they&rsquo;re born into. If I&rsquo;ve learned anything from my own life, that means instructing them regarding technology-powered sexual perils.</p>

<p>When I consider sexting, I have a few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why does it happen?</strong> Is it a new phenomenon or simply a new face for an old one?</li>
<li><strong>Who is responsible?</strong> Who is involved and why do they do what they do?</li>
<li><strong>What should we do?</strong> Is it bad? Should American adults take any action?</li>
</ul>


<p>I thought I&rsquo;d share some of my thoughts on those questions after reading The Atlantic&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/11/why-kids-sext/380798/">&ldquo;Why Kids Sext&rdquo;</a> (by <a href="http://hannarosin.com/">Hanna Rosin</a>).</p>

<h2>Why does it happen?</h2>

<p>The author provides several explanations:</p>

<h4>Kids pressure one another.</h4>

<blockquote><p>When surveyed, by far the most common reason kids give for sexting is that their boyfriend or girlfriend wanted the picture&hellip; Englander singles out a distinct minority (12 percent) she calls the “pressured sexters,” who say they sexted only because they felt pressure. These girls are more vulnerable. They tend to &hellip; sext because they think they can get a boyfriend&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>A sad part for me is the role of the boys/young men:</p>

<blockquote><p> This is how one of them described his game to me: “A lot of girls, they stubborn, so you gotta work on them. You say, ‘I’m trying to get serious with you.’ You call them beautiful. You say, ‘You know I love you.’ You think about it at night, and then you wake up in the morning and you got a picture in your phone.”</p></blockquote>

<p>People want to be loved and they want to have intimate relationships. It&rsquo;s very sad when that desire is exploited!</p>

<h4>Sexting is their only option for intimacy.</h4>

<p>I actually beleive that all humans (even mean ones) desire to be known deeply and loved by other humans.</p>

<blockquote><p>“I live literally in the middle of nowhere, &hellip;  parents weren’t going to drop me off &hellip; Our only way of being alone was to do it over the phone. It was a way of kind of dating without getting in trouble. A way of being sexual without being sexual, you know? And it was his way of showing he liked me a lot and my way of saying I trusted him.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, you can hear the desire for intimacy (people equate sex with intimacy).</p>

<blockquote><p>The kids in Louisa County, like kids everywhere, are chronically overscheduled&hellip; Nighttime is the only time teens get to have intimate conversations and freely navigate their social world&hellip; [T]hat means checking up on the latest drama on Twitter&hellip;, filling up their Instagram accounts, or asking a girl for a pic.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you hear the joke about hobbies &ldquo;keeping {someone} off the street.&rdquo; Apparently you can&rsquo;t steamroll the desire for for social interaction out of a child!</p>

<h2>Who is responsible?</h2>

<p>I see a few different players in this scene:</p>

<ul>
<li>askers: those who request sexts</li>
<li>senders: those who comply with requests (or send unsolicited)</li>
<li>&ldquo;The system&rdquo;: schools, goverments, technology, etc</li>
<li>parents</li>
</ul>


<h4>Is it the askers?</h4>

<p>Writ large, there are two kinds of &ldquo;asks&rdquo;: those from uninvolved parties and those from &ldquo;committed&rdquo; parters.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Guys would pile them up,” one girl who had graduated a year earlier told me&hellip;. “It was more of a baseball-card, showing-off kind of thing&hellip; like when they were little boys, playing with Pokémon cards.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first case, it&rsquo;s (apparently) a matter of dominion &ndash; another manifestation of treating females objects to obtain. Nothing new, but shows how far we&rsquo;ve come. (Which is: nowhere).</p>

<blockquote><p>In the vast majority of cases, the picture lands only where it was meant to&hellip; “The only reason to regret it is if you get caught,” one girl told me.</p></blockquote>

<p>This article assumes that sexting a &ldquo;committed partner&rdquo; is OK. Protip: you&rsquo;ll probably break up with high-school boyfriend.</p>

<p>When people are seen naked, they feel ashamed. When you ask for a naked picture, you&rsquo;re now toying with that person&rsquo;s dignity. Not OK. (But to be fair, most people don&rsquo;t know that.)</p>

<h4>Is it the senders?</h4>

<p>This article doesn&rsquo;t paint the senders as passive victims. It uses phrases like &ldquo;sexual experimenters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seems to me that the senders are pursuing intimacy in an unproductive way. They long to be known and accepted, but they&rsquo;re left with regret. Whether external (exposé) or internal (guilt &amp; shame), they might feel repercussions of their actions, which is always sad.</p>

<h4>Is it &ldquo;the system?&rdquo;</h4>

<p>I believe that the system is the sum of its parts. If society members behaved, the system would function. If the system is broken, look to the society members. So, the answer to this question is just the sum of the other answers. Moving on.</p>

<h4>Is it the parents?</h4>

<p>Parents are notably absent in this article. They appear a few times:</p>

<ul>
<li>shaming a child caught sexting</li>
<li>one bit of advice for parents understanding social media</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that we pair the &ldquo;cult of parenthood&rdquo; with a growing distaste for instructing children (or rather, relegating instruction to non-parents).</p>

<p>This article describes in detail how lawyers, police officers, researchers and children cope with sexting, but makes very little mention of parents. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a lack of focus in this article; I think it&rsquo;s a lack of focus in our culture. In fact, the article describes a sexting education meeting in Louisa County. Only &ldquo;about a dozen&rdquo; people attended.</p>

<h2>What should we do?</h2>

<blockquote><p>Teens in Louisa County, like teens everywhere, hear a lot about sex, but really know only a little about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>My instinct for solving this problem (like my instinct for solving all problems :S ) is to create &amp; disseminate knowledge. Obviously, I can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you people teach your kids right about sex?&rdquo; becuase I haven&rsquo;t done it. But I hope to get up the nerve by the time my turn comes:</p>

<ul>
<li>We all want to be known and loved by others; it&rsquo;s a very powerful desire.</li>
<li>To be seen naked is to be known. I can&rsquo;t explain it, but it&rsquo;s an old truth. It&rsquo;s why we wear clothes even when it&rsquo;s hot outside. It&rsquo;s why certain combinations of attire (or lack thereof) are inappropriate in public. It&rsquo;s why you have bad dreams of leaving your pants at home.</li>
<li>To be known but not loved is brutal: you&rsquo;re stripped bare but not embraced. I imagine that&rsquo;s the feeling when naked pictures become public (cf. &ldquo;L'enfer, c'est les autres&rdquo;, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze">&ldquo;Gaze&rdquo;</a>).</li>
<li>Similarly, to be loved but not known is hollow: a relationship based on mutual pride-appeasing may provide tastes of intimacy but it is not intimacy. Eyelash-batting will wear off and you&rsquo;re realize you never actually <em>loved</em> the other. You loved <em>being admired by the other.</em></li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re married, you&rsquo;re known by your spouse. If your spouse keeps his or her vows, you&rsquo;ll also be loved. Marriage is a place where humans can be fully known and fully loved without fear of abandonment. Certainly loving the &ldquo;stranger you&rsquo;re married to&rdquo; is hard, but you&rsquo;re not likely count your spouse like a baseball card.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciated the advice included in this article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Boyd advises parents not to, for example, shut down accounts&hellip;Instead, parents should take a deep breath—even in the most uncomfortable scenarios—and ask questions.</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess this is it: in my youth, internet pornography was the new menace that nobody warned us about &amp; we all fell prey to (indirectly, if not directly). What will it be for my children?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was just pondering whether a person ought to have children or not. It&rsquo;s funny when I try to be the judge.</p>

<p>Propagation of the human race is a funny business. There&rsquo;s no test for it. You don&rsquo;t even have to get a license, like you do for driving or for getting married. You just &hellip; <em>do</em> it. Even if you think about it carefully and make the decision with solemnity, that&rsquo;s no guarantee of the outcome. You might just get a rascal and there&rsquo;s nothing to be done about it.</p>

<h3>Judging</h3>

<p>I often find myself assessing whether something is good or bad, right or wrong, whether its something in my life, or something out in the world, or just an idea of this or that. In the end, I don&rsquo;t believe that I make a great judge: I don&rsquo;t have all the information, I&rsquo;m short-sighted and I&rsquo;m lacking in perception and wisdom.</p>

<p>I realized just now that in a way, it&rsquo;s just <em>not my role</em> to judge. I think that&rsquo;s the meaning of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+13:24/">Don&rsquo;t separate the wheat from the weeds, I&rsquo;ll do that at harvest time</a>&rdquo;. A person&rsquo;s job is to live a human life according to God&rsquo;s call. Generally, this means extending patience, forgiveness &amp; guidance in deference to God&rsquo;s judgements on his appointed day.</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s like&hellip;</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s like in a movie when a boy finds that the CEO&rsquo;s office is unlocked. He tiptoes to the tall, wide desk. He climbs into the big leather chair and gives it a swing to the right and left. He helps himself to a pen and practices his signature on the company letterhead. &ldquo;Very nice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, the door clicks again. It&rsquo;s the boss. With a downward flick of his finger, he signals for the boy to get down. Although the boy likes the feeling of the big chair, he&rsquo;s not fit for the duties of CEO.</p>

<h3>My Role</h3>

<p>This is freeing. I&rsquo;m prone to getting caught up in matters of judgement that are, in fact, beyond me. I would do well to determine the way that the Lord has put before me and walk it, leaving executive decisions to the executive. Throughout history and in my experience, he has proven worthy of that trust.</p>

<p>Certainly it&rsquo;s good to try to understand the world, but when you come up short, that&rsquo;s OK. The boss has the whole plan in mind and he&rsquo;s checked the accounts twice. It&rsquo;s going to add up! Fulfill your duties to the utmost!</p>
