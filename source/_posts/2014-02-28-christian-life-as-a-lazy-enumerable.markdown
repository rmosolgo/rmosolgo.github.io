Living a day at a time sounds a bit like [lazy enumeration](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-lazy).

Jesus said [not to worry about your life](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2B6%253A25-34/):

> "Do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself."

It's a bit like the lazy enumeration pattern. Don't load all the items into memory, just load the one you need right now. Loading all the days of your life right away [might not be worth it](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke%2B12%253A13-21/):

> "The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, ...  'Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.' But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'"

To be sure, Jesus must have had _some_ considerations for the future, if only to ["store up treasures in heaven"](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew%2B6%253A19-21/).
